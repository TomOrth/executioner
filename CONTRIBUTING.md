# Contributing
When contributing, please follow these guidelines:
1. Ensure that your changes do not break the project 
2. Update the version number in ```setup.py``` by 0.1 (ex: 0.1 becomes 0.2)
3. Update CHANGELOG.md, using the first entry as a template
4. Once these are all done, then you may open a pull request (if the above steps aren't followed and you open a pull request, it will not be merged and may be closed if not edited to follow these steps)
